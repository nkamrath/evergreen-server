EVERGREEN SERVER SETUP

These are the instructions for setting up a dev environment as well as a run environment for the maze server.

==== INSTALL MYSQL SERVER ====
MySQL server is required as it is the database behind the server.  Run:
$sudo apt-get install mysql-server

==== INSTALL DJANGO PYTHON AND PYTHON TOOLS ====
Django is the web framework for the web management and web site portal.  Run:
$sudo apt-get install python-django python-pip python-dev libmysqlclient-dev
need django-registration-redux for django auth app/pages
$sudo pip install django-registration-redux
$sudo pip install pymysql
$sudo pip install Pillow

==== INSTALL MYSQL CONNECTION FOR PYTHON ====
Python scripts are used to interact with the data base.  To install mysql python libraries Run:
$sudo pip install MySQL-python

==== INSTALLING MYSQL CONNECTION FOR C++ ====
C++ based server engine that facilitates all other  server back end functions besides the web site needs mysql connection.
$sudo apt-get install libmysqlcppconn-dev


==== SETTING UP THE DATABASE FOR DJANGO ====
Django is configured to use the Mysql database for storage, but the MySQL server must be configured correctly.  Run
$mysql -u root -p
Create a databse for the maze django app
$CREATE DATABASE maze_database CHARACTER SET UTF8;
Then create user and grant privileges as follows:
$CREATE USER maze@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'nellie';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON maze_database.* to maze@localhost;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
exit

==== MAKING INITIAL MIGRATIONS ====
Django will require some database setup of migrations.  In maze_site Run:
$python manage.py makemigrations 
$python manage.py migrate

==== SETTING UP DJANGO SUPERUSER ====
Creating a super user in django is always a good idea.  Run
$python manage.py createsuperuser
fill in requested details


At this point you should be able to run the django server.  Run djang server Run:
python manage.py runserver
